# Chicago Crime Map

This demo uses the [Flex.io Javascript SDK](https://www.flex.io/docs/javascript-sdk/) to read a table from local storage in Flex.io, filter its rows by year and output the result in JSON. The open-source data set is provided compliemnts of the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).

## Overview

[Flex.io](http://Flex.io)  is an API for moving, processing and integrating data in the cloud that helps developers build and deploy scalable data feeds with just a few lines of code. 

## Demo

https://flexiodata.github.io/examples/demo-chicago-crime-map/

## Installation

### Node.js

The preferred way of installing the Flex.io SDK for Node.js is to use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node.js package manager. Simply go to your project's directory and enter the following command at the command prompt:

```
npm install flexio-sdk-js
```

## Setup

You will need an API key in order to use the Flex.io Javascript SDK. You can sign up for a [Free Flex.io API Key here](https://www.flex.io/app/signup).

```javascript
Flexio.setup('YOUR_API_KEY')
```

## Code

All of the code that we'll build up in this example can be found in the [pipe.js](./pipe.js) file in this repository.

All Flex.io pipes start with `Flexio.pipe()`. Tasks in a pipe are chained together using periods similar to how jQuery and other APIs chain calls together.

```javascript
Flexio.pipe()
```

### Read

The `read` task allows you to read the contents of file that is located in local storage in Flex.io. Doing the following will read the contents of the table `tbl_chicago_homicides`.

```javascript
  .read('/home/tbl_chicago_homicides')
```

### Filter

The `filter` task allows us to output a reduced set of data from the input by apply a `where` condition. The value we'll filter on is `${form.year}` which comes from the `year` POST parameter.

```javascript
  .filter("year = '${form.year}'")
```

### Convert

The `convert` task allows you to convert the input from one format to another. In this particular step, we'll convert the output of the filter step above from tabular format into JSON.

```javascript
  .convert('table', 'json')
```

### Running the pipe in your Javascript code

Flex.io pipes can be run in your Javascript code right away without needing to be saved externally.

```javascript
  .run()
```

### Saving the pipe for later use

Once your pipe is doing exactly what you'd like, you may save it for later use. Saving a pipe is very useful as it will allow it to be called via the REST API or a cURL call with the specified pipe alias. We recommend adding your Flex.io username as a prefix to all of your aliases.

**NOTE: The alias `examples-demo-chicago-crime-map` below needs to be replaced with your own in order to save this pipe to your account. Best practices for aliases are to use your username as a prefix (e.g. `{username}-demo-chicago-crime-map`).**

```javascript
  .save({
    name: 'Chicago Crime Map',
    ename: 'examples-demo-chicago-crime-map'
  })
```

## Deploying the pipe

This is how you can run the saved pipe via an HTTP or cURL request:

```javascript
$.ajax({
  type: 'POST',
  url: 'https://www.flex.io/api/v1/pipes/{username}-demo-chicago-crime-map/run?flexio_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY',
  data: {
    year: 2017
  },
  dataType: 'json'
})
```

```
curl -X POST 'https://www.flex.io/api/v1/pipes/{username}-demo-chicago-crime-map/run' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d "year=2017"
```

To use the pipe you've saved with this example, edit line 221 of the [index.html](./index.html#L121) file and insert your pipe alias and API key.

```
  url: 'https://www.flex.io/api/v1/pipes/{username}-demo-chicago-crime-map/run?flexio_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY',
```
